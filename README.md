## Project Overview

The **Webank Online Banking System** is a middleware service designed to connect the frontend applications with a core banking system, providing a seamless online banking experience for users. The system consists of various modules to manage key functionalities such as user registration, account management, OTP verification, and access control. 

### Key Modules
- **OBS (Online Banking Service)**: Orchestrates requests for registration and OTP verification, forwarding them to the appropriate backend modules.
- **PRS (Personal Registration Service)**: Manages user registration and OTP verification.
- **DAS (Deposit Account Service)**: Handles account creation and balance management.
- **AAS (Account Access Service)**: Manages account access and authorization.
- **SMS Gateway**: Sends OTPs to users for verification purposes.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their phone numbers and public keys.
- **OTP Verification**: Secure one-time passwords are sent to usersâ€™ phones to verify identity.
- **Account Management**: Once registration is complete, users can create bank accounts, check balances, and view transaction histories.
- **Scalable Microservices Architecture**: Each service is designed as an independent microservice, allowing for modularity and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Spring Boot for the OBS, PRS, DAS, and AAS modules.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any preferred database system) for secure data storage.
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI for standardized API documentation.
- **Messaging and SMS**: Integrated SMS gateway for OTPs.

## Prerequisites
- **Java 11+**: Required to run the Spring Boot applications.
- **Maven**: Used for project dependency management.
- **Docker** (optional): For containerization and easier deployment.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the primary database for storing user and account data.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webank-online-banking-system.git
    cd webank-online-banking-system
    ```
2. **Run Database Migration**:
    - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and create necessary databases and tables (migration scripts are included in the `db/migrations` folder).

3. **Build and Run Services**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
4**Access API Documentation**:
    - The OpenAPI documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (or the port specified for each module).

## Starting application with Docker Compose

1. Whilst inside the project root directory, Run the command 
```bash
 docker compose up --build 
 ```
2. Access the API documentation at 
```bash
http://localhost:9200/swagger-ui.html
```
3. you can stop the application with 
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Usage
- **User Registration**:
    - Make a `POST` request to `/register` with `phoneNumber` and `publicKey`.
    - Receive an OTP on the provided phone number.
- **OTP Verification**:
    - Verify OTP by making a `POST` request to `/verify-otp` with the OTP and public key.
