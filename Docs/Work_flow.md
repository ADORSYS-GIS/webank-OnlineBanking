# GitHub Actions Workflow Documentation: Java CI/CD with Maven

### Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the "Java CI/CD Pipeline with Maven" workflow, which automates the building, testing, and code quality checks for your Java application.

### Workflow Trigger

The workflow is triggered by the following events:

* Push events: Direct commits to the `main` branch.
* Pull requests: Pull requests targeting the `main` branch.


### Workflow Jobs

**1. Test Stage**

Depends on: Successful completion of the Build stage.

Purpose: Runs unit and integration tests to verify code functionality.

Steps:
* Checkout Repository: Fetches the latest code (optional, can reuse from the previous job).
* Set Up JDK 17: Configures the Java 17 environment (optional, can reuse from the previous job).
* Run Unit Tests: Executes `mvn test` to run unit tests.
* Run Integration Tests: Executes `mvn verify` to run integration tests.


**2. Build Stage**

Purpose: Sets up the build environment, downloads dependencies, and builds the application.

Steps:
* Checkout Repository: Uses actions/checkout@v4 to fetch the latest code.
* Set Up JDK 17: Configures a Java 17 development environment using actions/setup-java@v4.
* Build with Maven: Executes `mvn clean install` to build the project.




**3. Code Quality Check with SonarQube**

Depends on: Successful completion of the Build stage.

Purpose: Analyzes code with SonarQube to identify potential issues and improve quality.

Steps:
* Checkout Repository: Fetches the latest code (optional, can reuse from previous jobs).
* Set Up JDK 17: Configures the Java 17 environment (optional, can reuse from previous jobs).
* SonarQube Scan: Executes `mvn sonar:sonar` with the following configuration:
    * **SONAR_TOKEN:** A secret containing your SonarQube token.
    * **sonar.organization:** Your SonarQube organization key.
    * **sonar.host.url:** Your SonarQube server URL.

**Note:** Ensure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository's settings.

### Additional Considerations

The provided YAML also includes commented-out sections for deployment and notification stages. You can customize and uncomment these sections to automate deployments and send notifications based on workflow outcomes.

### Troubleshooting

* Build Failures: Check for errors in your code or Maven configuration. Ensure compatibility between Java version and dependencies.
* Test Failures: Analyze test failures and fix underlying code issues.
* SonarQube Scan Issues: Verify your SonarQube token permissions, server URL, and organization key.

## Conclusion

This GitHub Actions workflow streamlines your Java development process by automating builds, tests, and code quality checks. By integrating these steps into your workflow, you can improve code quality, reduce errors, and accelerate development cycles.
